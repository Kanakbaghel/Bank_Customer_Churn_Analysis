# Introduction
A leading international bank is facing challenges with customer retention. Despite offering multiple financial products and services, many customers are closing their accounts and leaving for competitors. The bank’s management wants to leverage data analytics to predict customer churn and design strategies to improve customer loyalty. 
 
As a data analyst, you are tasked with analyzing customer data, identifying factors leading to churn, and building a simple model to predict whether a customer will exit the bank. 

-------------

# Problem Statement 
The goal is to build a predictive pipeline that helps the bank answer the question: 
“Which customers are at risk of leaving the bank?” 
 
This will help the bank’s marketing and customer success teams target the right customers with retention strategies.
