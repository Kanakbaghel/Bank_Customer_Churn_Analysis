### Introduction

In the highly competitive financial sector, customer retention remains a critical determinant of sustained profitability. A prominent international bank is currently facing elevated customer churn rates, with clients discontinuing accounts despite access to a diverse portfolio of financial products. This concerning trend poses significant risks to long-term growth and brand loyalty.

This Jupyter notebook systematically addresses the project objectives: data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns, development of predictive models for churn forecasting, and extraction of actionable business insights. The dataset encompasses customer demographics, account information, and behavioral attributes, featuring a binary target variable "Exited" (1 indicating churn, 0 indicating retention).

### Libraries Utilized

The analysis leverages the following key libraries to facilitate a robust end-to-end workflow, from data ingestion to insightful model evaluation:

- **pandas**: For efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
- **matplotlib and seaborn**: For creating visualizations and exploratory plots.
- **scikit-learn**: For preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and tools such as ROC curves and confusion matrices.
- **scipy**: For advanced statistical functions, including hierarchical clustering to explore unsupervised customer segmentation during EDA.

These tools ensure a comprehensive and reproducible approach to the analysis.

### Project Objectives

As a data analyst, the primary goals are to:

- Examine customer data to identify pivotal churn drivers, such as demographic profiles and account usage patterns.
- Develop and rigorously evaluate predictive models to classify customers as likely to retain or depart.
- Generate strategic recommendations to support targeted retention initiatives, including personalized incentives and proactive interventions for high-risk segments.
